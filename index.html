Hi! I am an <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/about-us/people/faculty/justin-canfil.html">Assistant Professor of International Relations & Emerging Technologies</a> at Carnegie Mellon University at the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology. I'm also a Research Associate at Princeton. My research concerns the politics of science and technology, including the regulation of emerging technologies, international technology competition, and military research and innovation. My current projects involving AI, cybersecurity, and arms control for "exotic technologies."

Prior to Carnegie Mellon, I was based at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Harvard Belfer Center, the Wilson Center, and the Harvard-Columbia China and the World Program. I was a China Fulbrighter (2019-2020) and received my PhD from Columbia University.
